This repository will house a canonical disassembly of Atari's The Learning
Phone cartridge, which is a PLATO terminal emulator.

Members of cyber1.org and AtariAge have been directly patching ROMs to work
best on the PLATO service available on http://cyber1.org/ and because of the
success of using this client, we probably should keep an official disassembly
that is sufficiently commented so that it can be modified easily.
